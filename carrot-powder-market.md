<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carrot Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Drying Carrot Powder</li><li>Freeze-dried Carrot Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carrot powder market primarily consists of two types: spray-dried carrot powder and freeze-dried carrot powder. Spray-drying involves rapidly evaporating moisture from carrot puree, resulting in a fine powder with a longer shelf life and concentrated flavor, making it ideal for food products and supplements. In contrast, freeze-drying preserves the nutritional quality and taste more effectively by removing moisture at low temperatures, resulting in a lighter, more rehydration-friendly powder, often used in gourmet cooking and health foods.</p></p>
