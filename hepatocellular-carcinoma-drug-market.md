<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hepatocellular Carcinoma Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemotherapy</li><li>Brachytherapy</li><li>Ablation Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) drug market encompasses various treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and ablation therapy. Chemotherapy involves systemic drugs targeting cancer cells, though its effectiveness in HCC is limited. Brachytherapy is a localized treatment where radiation sources are implanted directly into the tumor, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Ablation therapy employs techniques like radiofrequency or microwave energy to destroy cancer cells. Together, these approaches offer diverse options for managing HCC, tailored to patient needs and tumor characteristics.</p></p>
