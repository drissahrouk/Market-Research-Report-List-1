<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Fiber Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flat fiber cable market comprises primarily two types: single-mode and multi-mode cables. Single-mode fibers have a small core diameter, allowing light to travel in a single pathway, which results in longer transmission distances and higher bandwidth, making them ideal for long-haul applications. Multi-mode fibers, with a larger core, enable multiple light paths, which supports shorter distances and is suitable for data center interconnections. Both types are integral to modern telecommunications and data transmission infrastructures.</p></p>
