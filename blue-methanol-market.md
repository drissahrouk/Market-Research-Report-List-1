<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blue Methanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Natural Gas to Methanol"</li><li>"Coal to Methanol"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blue methanol market comprises two primary types: "Natural Gas to Methanol" (NGM) and "Coal to Methanol" (CM). Natural gas is converted into methanol through a process involving steam reforming, resulting in lower carbon emissions when paired with carbon capture technologies. In contrast, coal to methanol production utilizes coal as the feedstock, which typically generates higher emissions unless combined with carbon capture methods. Both pathways aim to produce methanol while addressing sustainability and reducing environmental impact.</p></p>
